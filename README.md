# Must-read-papers-on-3D-Graphs

Most existing GNNs are designed within 2 dimensions. However, many real world problems such as partical dynamics, molecular dynamics, are situated in 3 dimensions, which makes most existing GNNs models unfeasible to tackle these problems in the real world. To the end, I gather a bunch of recent papers which mostly focous on the 3D Graphs and their applications for those who are interested or now researching on this topic.
